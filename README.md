This repository is for my own convinient. I just started to play SCI again, and since I have 2 PC's I need to share my progress.  
I also created a short link to auto push/pull this repo and launch the game.  
For this I have an ENV variable `SC_BIN`, which points to the installation folder of Star Craft.  
Currently only for windows.
Commit message has a date in it, for (again) convinient reasons. Only works with `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss` like date formats
